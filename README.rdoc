= pusher-client (Ruby)

pusher-client is a ruby gem for consuming WebSockets from the Pusher[http://pusherapp.com] web service.

The connection to Pusher can optionally be maintained in its own thread (see Asynchronous Usage).

This gem is compatible with jruby since 0.2.

== Installation

  gem install pusher-client

== Single-Threaded Usage

The application will pause at socket.connect and handle events from Pusher as they happen.

  require 'pusher-client'

  PusherClient.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)
  options = {:secret => YOUR_APP_SECRET}
  socket = PusherClient::Socket.new(YOUR_APP_KEY, options)

  # Subscribe to a public channel
  socket.subscribe('channel')

  # Subscribe to an authenticated channel
  socket.subscribe('presence-channel', 'user_id')

  # Subscribe to an authenticated channel with optional :user_info
  socket.subscribe('presence-channel', 'user_id', { :name => 'name' })

  # Subscribe to array of channels
  ['channel1', 'channel2'].each do |c|
    socket.subscribe("presence-#{c}", 'user_id')
  end

  # Bind to global events (a catch-all for any 'event' across subscribed channels)
  socket.bind('event') do |data|
    puts data
  end

  # Bind to events that occur on a specific channel
  socket['channel'].bind('event') do |data|
    puts data
  end

  socket.connect

== Asynchronous Usage

The socket will remain open in the background as long as your main application thread is running,
and you can continue to subscribe/unsubscribe to channels and bind new events.

  require 'pusher-client'

  PusherClient.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)
  options = {:secret => YOUR_APP_SECRET}
  socket = PusherClient::Socket.new(YOUR_APP_KEY, options)
  socket.connect(true) # Connect asynchronously

  # Subscribe to a channel
  socket.subscribe('channel')

  # Bind to a global event
  socket.bind('event') do |data|
    puts data
  end

  loop do
    sleep(1) # Keep your main thread running
  end

For further documentation, read the source & test suite. Some features of the JavaScript client
are not yet implemented.

== Gotchas

When binding to a global event, note that you still must be subscribed to the channels the event
may be sent on. You can't just bind a global event without subscribing to any channels and call it a day.

== Contributing to pusher-client

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.

== TODOs

* Implement Channel instances associated with Subscription instances.
* Remove Subscriptions#find_for_bind workaround for lack of Channel instances
* Remove the duplication between Socket#subscribe and #subscribe_existing
* Test Socket.rb bind('pusher:connection_disconnected')
* Identify subscriptions on :channel and :user_id (rather than :user_data).
